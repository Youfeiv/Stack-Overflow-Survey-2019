## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 to better understand french developers:

1. What technologies do they use and how are the technologies are asscociated with the salaries.
2. What are the developer types and the breakdown salaries that come with.
3. An investigation on the education background of french developers.

## File Descriptions

There are 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist explain the code process.

There are 6 images extracted from the notebook to showcase the findings.

## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available here. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
